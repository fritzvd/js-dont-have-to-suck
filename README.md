JS don't have to suck
=====================

This is the repo for a presentation I held at the company I work: (Nelen & Schuurmans) [http://nelen-schuurmans.nl].
It contains a presentation with a small RESTful API server written in JS with a Postgres backend and a small Angular JS client to consume the RESTful API.
